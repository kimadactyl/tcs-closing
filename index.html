    <h1>Tai Chi School is closing down</h1>

    <p>
      <strong
        >Thank you to everyone who has supported Tai Chi School over the
        years.</strong
      >
      We’re deeply grateful for the encouragement, kind words, and enthusiasm
      you’ve shown us.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, the project has never been financially sustainable as we
      have never quite had the level of take up that we had hoped for and
      overall the business has made losses which we don’t think we can ever
      recover. With urgent technical upgrades now required and both founders
      having moved on to other projects (we haven’t made new content since
      before the pandemic), it’s no longer possible for us to continue running
      the website.

      As we wind things down,

        prices.</strong

      If you’d like to support us, picking one up is the best way to do so.

        >Customers, fear not: we’re working on archiving the full course on
        YouTube</strong
      >
      so it can be available permanently and free for anyone who wants to learn
      Tai Chi in the future. We hope that for some of you this is an upgrade to
      our current offer!
